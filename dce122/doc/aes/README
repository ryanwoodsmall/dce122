With the merger of X/Open and OSF, the previous practice of maintaining two
sets of specs will evolve into maintenance of a single set of CAE specs.
Therefore, the OSF "Application Environment Specification" term is being
phased out with the X/Open term "Common Application Environment"
specification superceding.
.P
Directories under aes/ contain PostScript files for the following
specifications:

o Remote Procedure Calls

o Security

o Directory Services

o Time Services

o Distributed File Service

o Threads

The directory for each specification contains a README detailing
its status.
